- Use `snake_case` for all variable and function names.
- Use `PascalCase` for class names.
- Keep functions under 30 lines when practical.
- Include docstrings for all public classes and functions using triple double-quotes (`"""`).
- Alphabetize imports and dependency lists where appropriate.
- Prefer early returns and guard clauses to reduce nesting.
- Use consistent spacing: one blank line between functions, two between classes.
- Limit nested blocks (if/for/while) to 2 levels deep for readability.
- Type hint all function arguments and return values.
- Prefer `f"{value}"` formatting over `%` or `.format()`.
- Use `with` blocks for file handling and resource management.
- Avoid vague names like `data`, `stuff`, or `temp`â€”be descriptive.
- Organize shared helper functions into `utils.py`.
- Avoid global variables unless absolutely necessary.
